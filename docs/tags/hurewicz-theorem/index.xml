      <description>This is part 5 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
As promised in the previous part, we are going to calculate $\pi_4(S^3)$. I think we will have to use all of the machinery (plus some new) that we have been through during this series to do the calculation. What more could we possibly need you ask?</description>
