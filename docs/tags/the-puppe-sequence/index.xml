      <description>This is part 6 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 7, 8 and 9.
Through the series so far we have covered the basic uses of fibrations and related things, like the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, the Serre spectral sequence, fiber bundles and homotopy groups of spheres. But, we have not mentioned that fibrations has a dual construct, namely cofibrations.</description>

      <description>This is part 3 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 4, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
For an introduction to the material, the definitions, motivation and some examples, please read part 1 and part 2 about fibrations and fiber bundles. This and the the following parts of this series will be about their usefulness, especially in computing homology and homotopy groups.</description>
