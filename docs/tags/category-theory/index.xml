      <description>Last fall I held a talk about functors, natural transformations and equivalences of categories. This talk was part two of five in a student seminar on introductory category theory. There was mostly second year students attending but also a couple more experienced students. To make the talk a bit interesting for them as well I said that an equivalence of categories is the correct notion of “sameness” of categories, and not isomorphisms due to the fact that categories naturally lie in a $2$-category.</description>
