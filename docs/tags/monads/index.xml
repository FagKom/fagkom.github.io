      <description>You may be thinking, what the heck is a monoid, and why the heck is it vertical? To explain this we will need some insight into classical categories and $2$-categories, which we luckily have been developing for the last few posts.

But, I like to visualize them and think about them as somehow vertical, or at least something not strictly horizontal or one-dimensional.</description>
