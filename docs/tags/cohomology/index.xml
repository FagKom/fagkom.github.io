      <description>This is part 4 of a series leading up to and exploring model categories. For the other parts see 1, 2, 3, 5 6, 7, 8 and 9.
My personal favorite part about fibrations is that they come equipped with a natural way to compute the cohomology of the total space from the cohomology of the base and the cohomology of the fibers. This process is encoded in a structure called a spectral sequence, and is a complicated object in its full generality.</description>
