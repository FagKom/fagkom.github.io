      <description>Some time ago I saw this problem of hanging a picture on the wall using a string and two nails in such a way that if you remove one of the nails from the wall, the picture falls down. This is a bad way to hang pictures you immediately say, and I would agree. I saw some solution to the problem, and didnâ€™t think about it for many years, until this week when I figured out that we need homotopy, in particular the fundamental group, to do it!</description>
