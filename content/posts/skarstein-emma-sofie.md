**Tittel:** The EM algorithm and some applications in population genetics

**Veileder:** [???]({{<ref "/veileder/???" >}}) 

**Sammendrag:** Using the EM algorithm we are able to estimate various genetic data where some aspect of the data is missing or unknown. We look at how assuming the Hardy-Weinberg principle lets us use the EM algorithm for estimating allele
frequencies. We also compare the EM algorithm to Newton’s method, with respect to stability and rate of convergence, and find that although Newton’s method is marginally better when given good starting values, the speed of convergence is much lower as soon as the starting values are less ideal, while the EM algorithm shows good performance throughout both the examples examined in this text.
