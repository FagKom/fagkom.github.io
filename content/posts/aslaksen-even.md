**Tittel:** Monads, algebras and descent theory

**Veileder:** [Drew Heard]({{< ref "/veileder/drew-heard" >}}) 

**Sammendrag:** This bachelor’s thesis is an exposition of the articles Facets of Descent I and III by G. Janelidze and W. Tholen on descent theory. We start by studying the preliminary theory of monads and the Barr–Beck theorem. Then, we develop the monadic approach to descent theory and the approach via Grothendieck fibrations. Finally, we give an elementary approach to the classical descent problem for modules and algebras.
