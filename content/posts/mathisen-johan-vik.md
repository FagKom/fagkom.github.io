**Tittel:** An introduction to triangulated categories via the stable category of a Frobenius category

**Veileder:** [Johanne Haugland]({{<ref "/veileder/johanne-haugland" >}}) 

**Sammendrag:** The goal of this thesis is to prove that the stable category of a Frobenius category is triangulated. This thesis is divided into two parts. Part one consists of an introduction to triangulated categories, with emphasis on intuition and motivation. Part two is an introduction to exact and quotient categories, leading up to the triangulation of the stable Frobenius category.
