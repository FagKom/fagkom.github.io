**Tittel:** Modular forms and ∆

**Veileder:** [Kristian Seip]({{<ref "/veileder/kristian-seip">}}) 

**Sammendrag:** The theory of modular forms sits in the intersection of the mathematical branches: number theory, complex analysis, topology, algebraic geometry and group theory. For example, they play a part in the proof of Fermats last theorem by Andrew Wiles and
have surprising connections to the Monster simple group via the j-invariant and Richard
Brocherds' moonshine theory. In this bachelors project we investigate the simplest case
of a modular form, level 1 and integer weight, using undergraduate level complex analysis
with a sprinkle of group theory and linear algebra. We use the theory to prove that the
modular discrimant, a special modular form, has multiplicative Fourier coefficients - a
theorem conjectured by Ramanujan and proved by Mordell.
