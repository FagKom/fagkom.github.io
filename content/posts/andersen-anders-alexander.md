**Tittel:**  Cobordism theory: An introduction to topological pants

**Veileder:**  [Gereon Quick]({{< ref "/veileder/gereon-quick" >}})

**Sammendrag:** The main goal of this thesis is to give an introduction to $(B, f)$-cobordism and cobordism groups, which is related to the stable homotopy group of the spectrum of the Thom spaces of the universal bundles of the infinite grassmannians. To this end, we first give a brief exposition on manifolds, grassmannian manifolds, and cobordism categories in the classical sense of [12]. In the final chapter, we develop the techniques to introduce general structure of the stable normal bundle, prove the generalized Pontrjagin-Thom Theorem.
