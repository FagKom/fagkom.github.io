**Tittel:** The Mathieu eleven group is a sporadic finite simple group

**Veileder:** [Øystein Skarsæterhagen]({{<ref "/veileder/øystein-skarsæterhagen">}})

**Sammendrag:** We know there exists an infinite number of groups, and so trying to explicitly define each and every one of them seems like an impossible task. Actually, even classifying every finite group is by some considered impossible. However, much like prime numbers are the building blocks of the natural numbers, finite simple groups are considered to build up the finite groups. And in 1972 Daniel Gorenstein proposed a 16-step program to classify all finite simple groups. The final classification came in 2004, which followed his outline quite closely, and consisted of more than 10 000 pages.
