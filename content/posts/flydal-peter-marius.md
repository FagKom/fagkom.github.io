**Tittel:**  The model category of simplicial groups is left proper

**Veileder:** [Markus Szymik]({{<ref "/veileder/markus-szymik">}})

**Sammendrag:** In this bachelor thesis, we consider the category of simplicial groups as a (closed) model category, and, after defining some central concepts that are needed to understand the topic, prove that it is left proper, i.e., that cobase extensions of weak equivalences along cofibrations become weak equivalences themselves.
