**Tittel:** A homological approach to the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem

**Veileder:** [Markus Szymik]({{<ref "/veileder/markus-szymik">}})

**Sammendrag:** The goal of this thesis is to develop some tools including Hochschild cohomology, filtered and graded algebras and algebraic deformation theory in order to take a conceptual approach to proving the Poincare-Birkoff-Witt(PBW) theorem. The thesis will follow the proof of a generalized version of the theorem given in [BG96] and [Wit19].
