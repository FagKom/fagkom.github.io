---

**Tittel:** Sheaf cohomology and duality

**Veileder:** [Rune Haugseng]({{< ref "/veileder/rune-haugseng" >}}) 

**Sammendrag:** The goal of this thesis is to prove the Verdier and Poincaré duality theorems for coefficients in a field. Generalisations of course exist, but we will concentrate on proving that for some fixed field $k$, there is an isomorphism between cohomology and cohomology with compact support. Before we do this, we will spend a generous amount of time building a theory of sheaves and in particular we will look at some very important operations that can be done on sheaves.
