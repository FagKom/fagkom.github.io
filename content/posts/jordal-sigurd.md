**Tittel:** On finite simple groups

**Veileder:** [Steffen Oppermann]({{<ref "/veileder/steffen-oppermann">}})

**Sammendrag:** This text is intended for undergraduate students in mathematics. For research I have used resources made by Keith Conrad, P.B.Bhattacharya, Ronald Solomon, Robert Wilson, S.K.Jain, and S.R.Nagpaul. In addition I would like to thank my supervisor Steffen Oppermann, who has given me guidance and a lot of his time.
